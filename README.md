# ASSR_Project_Data
This repository contains data and code utilized in the manuscript "Overcoming Threshold Concepts: Developing a Johnstone's Triangle-Based Evaluation Rubric for a Multilayer Laboratory Course" (Nkomo et al., 2023). PDF copies of the Assignment-specific Scoring Rubric (ASSR) and the Generalized Rubric (GR) are accessible here.  

An Excel file containing scores generated by the ASSR is included. Also available is an R script conducting a paired t-test for average pre- and post-assessment scores within each dimension of the ASSR. Both the paired t-tests and normality assessments are replicated via SAS's PROC TTEST statement. For questions regarding access or contents of the repository, please contact the corresponding author indicated on the manuscript.
